It is the University policy that the preferred way of achieving this is by means of an Online Module Evaluation Questionnaire Survey. Students will be invited to complete the questionnaire survey for this module at the end of the semester. You are strongly advised to read the policies mentioned below very carefully, which will help you better perform in your academic studies. All the policies and regulations related to your academic study can be found in Student Academic Services section under the heading “Policies and Regulations” on E-bridge. 1.3.2 Plagiarism, Cheating, and Fabrication of Data. Offences of this type can result in attendance at a University-level committee and penalties being imposed. You need to be familiar with the rules. Please see the “Academic Integrity Policy” available on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’. 1.3.3 Rules of submission for assessed coursework The University has detailed rules and procedures governing the submission of assessed coursework. You need to be familiar with them. Details can be found in the “Code of Practice for Assessment” available on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’. 1.3.4 Late Submission of Assessed Coursework The University attaches penalties to the late submission of assessed coursework. You need to be familiar with the University’s rules. Details can be found in the “Code of Practice for Assessment” available on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’. 1.3.5 Mitigating Circumstances The University is able to take into account mitigating circumstances, such as illness or personal circumstances which may have adversely affected student performance on a module. It is the student’s responsibility to keep their Academic Advisor, Programme Director, or Head of Department informed of illness and other factors affecting their progress during the year and especially during the examination period. Students who believe that their performance on an examination or assessed coursework may have been impaired by illness, or other exceptional circumstances should follow the procedures set out in the “Mitigating Circumstances Policy”, which can be found on e-Bridge in the Student Academic Services section under the heading ‘Policies and Regulations’. 1.3.6 ICE and GitHub Copies of lecture notes and other materials are available electronically through GitHub. They might be moved to ICE, the University’s virtual learning environment at ICE @ XJTLU, in the future. 1.4 Required materials As this module is focused on data analysis, every student must work on a computer with internet access. Either Windows, macOS or Linux is accepted. Data processing and presenting software packages must be installed in your computer. As our assignments will be reproducible, R Markdown is the first choice in the class, and RStudio is an enhanced user interface for R. We are going to work with markdown in the framework of reproducible research, thus Typora is recommended as a markdown editor. If you don’t like R, you can use Jupyter notebook or other software packages for your assignments and presentations. However, all the examples in the lectures will be given in R. Reproducible research by Wikipedia: The term reproducible research refers to the idea that the ultimate product of academic research is the paper along with the laboratory notebooks and full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code, data, etc. that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research. Typical examples of reproducible research comprise compendia of data, code and text files, often organised around an R Markdown source document or a Jupyter notebook. Sometimes, if we have to use office packages, LibreOffice is recommended. We WON’T use Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) in the class unless we have no other choices. After class, you are free to use any software as you like. Exercise: Install R in Windows like this: Open the download page on R official website: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/. Click ‘Download R x.x.x for Windows’ (x.x.x is the version, e.g. 3.6.2) at the top of the webpage, and the installation file will be downloaded. Double click the downloaded file and follow the instruction until it is installed. Exercise: Install RStudio like this: Open the download page on the RStudio official website: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Click ‘DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO FOR WINDOWS’. Double click the downloaded file and follow the instruction until it is installed. Install Typora like this: Open the download page on Typora official website: https://typora.io/#windows. Click ‘Download Beta (xyy)’ (yy is the microprocessor type of your computer. You can find it by right click This PC – properties) at the top of the webpage, and the installation file will be downloaded. Double click the downloaded file and follow the instruction until it is installed. 1.5 Markdown syntax All your assigned coursework (exercises and assignments) must be reproducible, i.e. given in markdown syntax in this module. Why markdown? For asking questions GitHub Stackoverflow Capital of Statistics For creating scientific products, such as Writing reports/documents/manuscripts/theses Making slides/posters Building websites (ncov2020.org, yihui.org, openr.pzhao.org) For team collaboration and reproducibility Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. — WIKIPEDIA Fig.2. Handwritten and printed markdown Markdown is NOT a certain software package. It is a set of writing rules. Many software packages can open markdown files: Notepad Notepad++ https://stackedit.io/ Typora https://web.marp.app/ (example https://marp.app/) RStudio Table 2. Key Syntax of Markdown You type You get *italic* italic **bold** bold PM~2.5~ subscript \\(\\text{PM}_{2.5}\\) R^2^ superscript \\(\\text{R}^2\\) $E = mc^2$ equations: \\(E = mc^2\\), \\(G = \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i = 1}^{n} x_i}\\) [link](https://xjtlu.edu.cn) hyperlink link ![](image) insert an image # Chapter 1 headings 1. list... numbered list - list... unnumbered list You can open Typora, and type the texts in the left column of Table 2. See what happens. Click the &lt;/&gt; button at the left bottom of typora. Click it again. Again. Exercise: Github support markdown. Visit the Markdown Practice issue, and type anything with markdown syntax. Every syntax in Table 2 must be practised. Exercise: Use markdown in your every day study/life and Write a document, a meeting protocol, a diary, a lab report, etc., and present it in the seminar of this week. Exercise: Use markdown in your every day study/life and Write a document, a meeting protocol, a diary, a lab report, etc., and present it in the seminar of this week. Discussion: What academic software for data analysis do you often use in your research area? Make a list and give us a short introduction in the seminar. 1.6 Seminar/practice 1.6.1 Discussion: Software for data analysis Bella RStudio is often used for analyze the correlationships between different variables. Excel is usually used for collect data and do some simple caculations. Wanqi SAS: Use as a beginer. SAS has strong function, and is friendly to many language, while codes may be complex and long. R: I use it for better communication. R studio: I only learn it but haven’t use it in research. Stata: I use it to analysis clinical data for better communication. Hadoop: Big data analysis with better communication. Jane R 1.6.2 Practice: Markdown, R markdown, and reproducible research "]
